## Bootstrapping the eDPPL page

For this exercise we'll take the [edppl page](http://dppl.org/edppl) on the library's website and bootstrap it.

### Layout

The layout file ( `edppl-layout.png` ) is a basic wireframe of what the layout should look like.

### Images

The images from the original page are located in the `img` directory.
